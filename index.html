                    I got my start in design in 2012 designing IOS apps for freelance project
                    on Odesk. Since then i've worked with 50+ founders and stratup across <span>WORLD</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been a stratup founder myself and co-founded a <span>music chat app called Lisn</span>
                    that had its momment of virality with <span>8k+ users.</span>. Im also the author of the Amazon best

                    Most recently i was the <span>Head Of Design at Unacademy,</span> an ed-tech startup that has raised around <span>$200M</span> from global
